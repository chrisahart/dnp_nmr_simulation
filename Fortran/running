First confirm that this works using my own file for matrix exponential
Try and get this working on Windows, no idea if .o files will be compatible
If not post on Stackoverflow

Then test speed using Intel matrix multiplications

Finally get a version of code running on Ubuntu, saving output to file and printing using Python
